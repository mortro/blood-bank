As every year, the International Open Data Day will take place this weekend. Of course Cologne is participating and the tech community is organizing a big event during the weekend: the [Open Data Day Köln](http://opendataday.koeln.de/)

## International Hack Day

What is the International Open Data Hack Day?

[As you can read on](http://opendataday.org/) _"it's a gathering of citizens in cities around the world to write applications, liberate data, create visualizations and publish analyses using open public data to show support for and encourage the adoption open data policies by the world's local, regional and national governments."_ The event is open for everybody: _"developers, designers, librarians, statisticians, citizens or anybody who has an idea for using open data, want to find an interesting project to contribute towards, learn about how to visualize or analyze data or simply want to see what's happening."_

## What will happen in Cologne

How will the Open Data Day in Cologne look like? The event will be split in two days (of course one day is not enough). The first day will take place at Startplatz on **Saturday, 23rd February**. We will hack the whole day there. For more information [just have a look at our schedule](http://opendataday.koeln.de/#programm).

**On Sunday, February 24th we'll continue working** on our projects at the brand new [Coworking Cologne Space "Bottfabrik"](https://foursquare.com/v/bottfabrik/51065f84e4b05421af87377f).
