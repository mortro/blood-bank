<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/51511255">Rails Girls Cologne - September 2012</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/user14112349">Liane Th&ouml;nnes</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

On September 28th + 29th we were happy to welcome more than 60 women to
[Rails Girls Cologne](http://railsgirls.com/cologne), a two-day crash course on Ruby on Rails. When Liane and I participated in the Berlin workshop earlier this year we quickly agreed: „We need to bring this event to Cologne!“. No sooner said than done: Back in Cologne we started to look for sponsors and coaches. Even though we couldn't offer sponsors much more than good karma, it didn't take us long to find great companies willing to support our event.
Right on time for the event, all the preparations were finished. Luckily we work at Gasmotorenfabrik Köln - a coworking space - and it didn‘t cause us any difficulties finding coaches because the Railslove team are a bunch of folks very eager and excited to coach ;)

Now onto the workshop ... It all started with the Installation Fest on
Friday evening. With a little help from the coaches, the girls installed Ruby on Rails on their laptops and got to know each other while sipping sparkling wine and eating awesome Rails Girls Cake baked by [Anita](http://www.cakefriday.de/) (@sankurachi). What shouldn‘t be missing was the [FridayHug!](http://hugfriday.com/) with all the attendees!

The next morning began with a cup of coffee and a short talk by Nadia
Zaboura from [CREATIVE.NRW](http://www.creative.nrw.de/). Right after that [Liane](https://twitter.com/liane_thoennes) and [I](https://twitter.com/schlafturbine) held a workshop about the design process while building a web app. Things got serious after our talk: With the laptops all ready to go, the girls took their first steps into coding. [Jan](https://twitter.com/koos) explained Ruby basics by going through the interactive tutorial tryruby.org. Divided into small teams and equipped with some basic knowledge, the girls started to create their first simple web app (layout, adding pictures, gems, bundles, and a bunch of other stuff). Coaches were around to help answer questions and explain the steps the whole time.
Everyone seemed bright and motivated, and it was awesome to see so many
girls interested in tech.

After lunch [Jakob](https://twitter.com/jkwebs) recapped what we‘ve done so far by using the „Bentobox“ as an example. In the afternoon there were some more
inspiring lightning talks by our female coaches. [Joan](https://twitter.com/joanwolk) held a very fascinating talk about how she became a programmer in just a year and [Karen](https://twitter.com/KarenSijbrandij) gave us some insights into her life as a female programmer. And last but not least [Michael](https://twitter.com/bumi) told us about the most important thing in the Ruby on Rails community: M-I-N-S-W-A-N (check it out yourself ;)
Before we all met again at the after party the attendees had the time to finish their apps. This great day ended with a chilled-out concert and a fun party ...


... but now, three weeks later we want more!
On 6th of November we will have our first Rails Girls Cologne meet-up at [Gasmotorenfabrik](http://www.facebook.com/Gasmotorenfabrik?ref=ts&fref=ts). Coaches will be there to help us realize our own ideas and we‘ll start working our way through the [R‘o‘R Tutorial](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/) by Michael Hartl. Everyone is welcome, just join our google group https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=de&fromgroups#!forum/rails-girls-cologne
