As you already know ([Liane](http://railslove.com/liane_thoennes) & [Tatjana](http://railslove.com/tatjana_lajendaecker)) from [Rails Girls Cologne](http://railsgirls.com/cologne) are making exciting things happen next week! On Friday and Saturday will be a Rails Girls event - this time in our beautiful city Cologne.

On Saturday evening we've orginized an superb party for you. Our friends [Timo](https://twitter.com/teemow) (working at [Adcloud](http://adcloud.com)) and Malte helped us making this great party with live music happen:

**[Malte von Griesgram](http://griesgram.com/)** and 
**As Fake As I Know (AFAIK)**

Everything starts at 6 PM at [Jack in the Box](http://www.koelnerbox.de/). It would be awesome if you could attend the [official Facebook-Event](https://www.facebook.com/events/105384209619006/) and tell your friends about this awesome party night!
