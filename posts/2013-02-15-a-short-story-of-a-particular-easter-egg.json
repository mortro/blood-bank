As of today, Railslove.com has a new easter egg, replacing My Little Pony easter egg I put in April last year:

This easter egg brought attention of [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/stnm4/lower_your_volume_then_hit_up_up_down_down_left/), [Cheezeburger](http://cheezburger.com/6173322496), and [several](http://www.funnyjunk.com/channel/ponytime/Website+Cheat+Code/TMkgGGZ/) [other](http://kwejk.pl/obrazek/1131114) [communities](http://www.equestriadaily.com/2012/04/nightly-roundup-303.html) around the Internet. It was so popular, it [brought down our website]()!

Right now it's time to goodbye to ponies on our website (well, not really ;)), while new  easter eggs are being implemented. We will work on a page showcasing all easter eggs we had previously, so our fans from previous generations of easter eggs won't feel left alone.

In the meantime, keep calm and brony on!
