On October 18th the second CREATIVE.NETWORK event took place at Gasmotorenfabrik.
From 3-6 p.m. our office was filled with more than 70 particiapants who came to receive advice from the CREATIVE.NRW Team (Anja Fischer, Matthias Kliefoth, Carolin Paulus and Nadia Zaboura). In a relaxing atmosphere new business ideas were developed and already existing ideas sharpened. Meanwhile the CREATIVE.NRW Team explained their work and the idea behind CREATIVE.NRW.

Oliver Wittmann,  the new contact person of „Kompetenzzentrum Kultur- und Kreativwirtschaft des Bundes für NRW“ provided advice to creative heads from all sectors in individual sessions.

After 6 p.m. the whole team was available for discussions and advice while sipping a glass of Kölsch and some yummy pumpkin soup.  
Fun was the opportunity for the participants to become creative themselves. Everyone could print the new CREATIVE.NRW logo on a bag, using screen printing! You can find all the pictures of the event [here](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10151107436491915.437545.239105926914&type=3).

It was great having so many creative heads and talented founders in our rooms. Railslove is always happy to support the local startup scene and events like this! Thanks to CREATIVE.NRW for organizing this great event at Gasmotorenfabrik.
