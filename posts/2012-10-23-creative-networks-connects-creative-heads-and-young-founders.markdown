On October 18th the second CREATIVE.NETWORK event took place at [Gasmotorenfabrik](http://www.facebook.com/Gasmotorenfabrik?ref=tn_tnmn).
From 3-6 p.m. our office was filled with more than 70 particiapants who came to receive advice from the CREATIVE.NRW Team (Anja Fischer, Matthias Kliefoth, Carolin Paulus and Nadia Zaboura). In a relaxing atmosphere new business ideas were developed and already existing ideas sharpened. Meanwhile the [CREATIVE.NRW](http://www.creative.nrw.de/) Team explained their work and the idea behind CREATIVE.NRW.

[Oliver Wittmann](http://www.facebook.com/KreativNRW),  the new contact person of „Kompetenzzentrum Kultur- und Kreativwirtschaft des Bundes für NRW“ provided advice to creative heads from all sectors in individual sessions.

After 6 p.m. the whole team was available for discussions and advice while sipping a glass of Kölsch and some yummy pumpkin soup.  
Fun was the opportunity for the participants to become creative themselves. Everyone could print the new CREATIVE.NRW logo on a bag, using screen printing! You can find all the pictures of the event [here](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10151107436491915.437545.239105926914&type=3).
