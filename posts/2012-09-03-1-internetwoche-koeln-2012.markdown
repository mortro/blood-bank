Besides the monthly events in our [#meetrailslove](http://railslove.com/blog/2012/09/03/meetrailslove-in-september) update for September there will be one big event this month: the [internetweek in Cologne](http://iwcgn.koeln.de/).

This years internetweek in Cologne is even bigger then the last ones and we're very exited about the events during the week.

As every year so far, [Railslove](http://iwcgn.koeln.de/2012/teilnehmer/railslove.html) and the [Coworking Space Gasmotorenfabrik Köln e.V.](http://iwcgn.koeln.de/2012/teilnehmer/gasmotorenfabrik-koeln-e-v.html) are participating in the internetweek hosting and (co-)organising a few events. This year we're organizing the [morning Yoga-Session](https://tivity.de/activities/789-chillax-hard-fighting-pirate-yoga-calms-the-sea), the [DevHouseFriday Chillout meetup](http://devhousefriday.org/networks/events/show_event.64116), we're hosting the [Hackathon 'hacknoon' on wednesday afternoon](http://hackanoon.com/) and the [Javascript Usergroup (Cologne.js)](http://colognejs.de/) on tuesday and besides many other events some of us are visiting the [EPS'12](http://piratesummit.com/)! The internetweek takes place at the same time as the [dmexco conference](http://www.dmexco.de/) in Cologne, also worth to visit. Let's have a detailed look at the events during this week:

## The Weekend before

For hackers everything starts a bit earlier - at the weekend. We're starting friday with the ["Disrupt or Die"](http://disrupt.geekcelerator.com/) event. #DorD is an elite-only 3 days event (Sept. 7th - 9th), specially designed by [Geekcelerator](http://launch.geekcelerator.com/) for outstanding geeks passionate about building products addressing global markets, outliers who are working on a prototype and are aiming for disruption. The event is free, but invite-only. 

On Sunday (Sept. 9th, morning - afternoon) you should join the [Leancamp](http://www.wantworkshop.com/workshops/leancamp/locations/gm-cologne). It's is a high-energy day focused on learning and sharing different approaches to getting to market, from business model innovation, to user experience design, to agile – with Lean Startup at the centre. The Leancamp Cologne will be run by Salim Virani & Rob Fitzpatrick. Sunday evening you can join the [Socialbar Pirates meetup at betahaus](http://www.socialbar.de/wiki/Koeln).

## Monday

Phuu! What a weekend... so let's have a look at the week. As mentioned before you should visit our [morning Yoga-Session](https://tivity.de/activities/789-chillax-hard-fighting-pirate-yoga-calms-the-sea) on Monday! Don't miss that - you will need it! It will be a light-version of our normaly heavy [Ashtanga Yoga](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashtanga_Vinyasa_Yoga) sessions, so you won't need a shower afterwards. Now you can start the week relaxed, open minded and you can join the [Finding the right startup-idea](http://startupidea.eventbrite.com/) event. It's a [Berlin Startup Academy](http://berlinstartupacademy.com/) workshop about "how to find and identify a worthwhile startup idea", "which ideas to avoid and why" and "idea pitching basics".

## EPS '12

ARRRRSO the [European Pirate Summit 2012 (EPS)](http://piratesummit.com/) starts monday afternoon at about 1 PM (a 2 day event) at [Odonien](http://www.odonien.de/). If you don't know anything about the EPS (what a shame!) have a reading here: [European Pirate Summit is Setting Sails Again – EPS ''12!](http://railslove.com/blog/2012/04/25/european-pirate-summit-is-setting-sails-again-eps-12) Meet hackers, investors, startups, drink Rum with them and have fun - like a real pirate! Don't miss the party! After two days of sailing you should join the [Startup Pirates Brunch](https://www.facebook.com/events/519880184694042/).

## Tuesday - Thursday

Tuesday evening, as usual once a month, there will be a meetup with the guys from [Cologne.js (Javascript Usergroup)](http://colognejs.de/). If you're interessted in Javascript and web developent at all you should check it out. The talks starting at 7PM in our space the [Gasmotorenfabrik in Cologne](http://cowoco.heroku.com/spaces/3). Don't miss it!

Okay. Not tired yet? You're a hacker? What's next? On wednesday evening you can have a glass of rum with fellows from the dmexco at the [OMClub Party](http://www.omclub.de/). After that you will have a really big hangover, right? So thursday is a day off. Maybe you would like to visit a thermal spa area in Cologne? Try [Neptunbad in Köln](http://www.neptunbad.de/) and then take the rest of the day off.

## Friday

As every year, we're closing the internet week with the [DevHouseFriday Chillout](http://devhousefriday.org/networks/events/show_event.64116) event. A 2-monthly-meetup for hacker and thinker. Programing language and skills really doesn't matter. **If you want to talk about Android, iPhone, Ruby, Java, Haskell or something else - this is the place to be - just send us a talk proposal (jan@railslove.com, gl@salesking.eu) - that's it.** This time we will meet in [Clusterhaus](http://clusterhaus.de) near Friesenplatz. We hope to get a lot of hacker together and have intersting talks. After or during our talks we will have a BBQ in the garden. Just bring your steak and beer along!
