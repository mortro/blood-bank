A Ruby on Rails workshop called [Rails Girls Rheinland](http://www.railsgirls.com/rheinland) will take place in Monheim (between Cologne and Dusseldorf) on March 1st – 2nd at the [innoQ](http://www.innoq.com/) headquarter. The event is aimed at providing women with the tools to better understand technology through ROR.

[Tatjana](http://railslove.com/team/tatjana_lajendacker/) and [I](http://railslove.com/team/liane_thonnes/) attended our first Rails Girls workshop in Berlin in early 2012 and it was so incredibly inspiring and motivating that we both decided quickly: We want to bring Rails Girls to Cologne. So after a few months of organizing the Cologne event took place in September and was absolutely fabulous. Take a look at the video …

Just a few days after the event we were asked if we'd be interested in organizing another Rails Girls event in Monheim. As we in Cologne had about three times more applicants than we could accept this was just a perfect chance. So well: Yes! Let's do it again.

And we're just really excited about the upcoming workshop in Monheim. There's so much going on in the whole Cologne / Bonn / Dusseldorf area. The creative scene in NRW is bubbling and there's loads of tech agencies who would love to find a great girl developer. The Cologne event showed us that there is a critical mass of interested and motivated girls and females to really redefine technology and to build out a completely new software engineering culture.

**Rails Girls**

The aim of Rails Girls is to give females the tools to understand technology, but also bring them the community and inspiration. We believe that education is the most important driver of change in the world, and the tech scene is no exception. We want to help girls break down that first barrier, the insecurity of diving into technology. So we provide a first experience on building things. 

A good part of the attendees will finish their applications and some will continue to develop them at home along with exercises and looking more into the developer and tech community flourishing around the Rheinland. That’s the most important, as Rails Girls is a first experience into Ruby on Rails, but to improve a language only practice makes perfect.

**The event**

The program is free, and women of any age with very basic knowledge of how to use a computer can participate – although the majority are usually aged in their 20s and 30s. However, at Rails Girls Cologne we had some 15 & 16 year olds who were really enthusiastic about this and on the other hand we had ladies in their 50s and 60s on board - they all just want to learn how to code.

Our coaches are there to answer questions and keep a positive vibe. The environment is supportive, enjoyable and sometimes quite girly – although I must say that guys are also welcome to join in the fun, especially for our after party. So far, we’ve always had some guys as coaches, and sometimes as speakers too.

We are really fortunate to have the support of some local sponsors and a very supportive cooperation partner who are ensuring that we can bring this opportunity to girls and women in the Rheinland area. We are grateful to the cooperational support of [Nadia Zaboura](https://twitter.com/nadia_z) and [CREATIVE.NRW](http://creative.nrw.de) as well as our sponsors [innoQ](http://www.innoq.com/) and [Railslove](http://www.railslove.com/). 

I think the entire attitude of the workshop is summed up with ‘Why the hell not?’ Why shouldn’t I learn how to program? Why shouldn’t I make a career out of it? I think if any of us had doubts that we couldn’t do it, Rails Girls set us straight.

I’m fully confident that the girls will dive in, continue to learn Ruby on Rails and potentially build powerful web applications in the future.

So Ladies all around the Rheinland and NRW:
