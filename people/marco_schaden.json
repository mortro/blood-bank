After some time of concentrating on business subjects, he fell in love with programming again when he discovered Ruby and Rails in 2010. He loves gadgets from the Apple universe and lives in Cologne with wife and child. Even though he's a metal head, he's actually quite a nice guy... who's totally addicted to M&M's.",
